# Exercise

- Run this service locally
- Add a markdown file with your name such as Emmanuel.md that would contain all responses to questions in this file.
- Explain each step of the installation process in your markdown file.
- Explain the use of cors within server.js
- Setup a frontend with any framework of your choice or vanilla to consume data from this backend service. (Ideally it should returna a list of students and when an item on the list is clicked is should make a seperate request to the API for a single student.)
